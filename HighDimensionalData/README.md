# High Dimensional Data Analysis Project

The aim of the project is to replicate the analysis carryed out in the 8th chapter of the “Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models” by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. The chapter explains the various method to handle missing values. So, starting from the book's analysis we have integrated the author's work with what we have learned during the course's lectures. 

The Chicago datasets are available at the book's [Github page](https://github.com/topepo/FES/tree/master/08_Handling_Missing_Data) while the scat dataset is available on R.
