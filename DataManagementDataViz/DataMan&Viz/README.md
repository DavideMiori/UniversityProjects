# Data Management and Visualization Project

For this project we have collected all the tweets from the Earth day (04-22-2021) containing specific hashtags such as #eartday, #plasticfree, #climatechange...    
We have translated these hashtags in different languages in order to reach as many countries as possible and we have applied Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining 
techniques on the collected data. Then, we have integrated the results with various socioeconomic and enviromental indices.  
At the end, after the data had been stored on Mongo, we have realized some visualizations 
available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/davide.miori/viz/Earthday-ProgettoDMDVCarloneMioriOndei_16311093096770/Storia).

In this repository, you can find a pdf file where we summarize (in italian) what we have done. In addiction three jupyter files are available: in this case the producer and the consumer files contain the code to collect tweets from Twitter in real time while the MainCode contains the code for creating the final data.
