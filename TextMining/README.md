# Text Mining Project

The project is divided into two tasks: Text Classification and Text Clustering.  
The first task concerns the development of a classifier able to predict if an article is fake or real while the second task aims to cluster the articles based on their source.  
Both the two analysis have a common preprocessing phase which is necessary to process the articles so that they are suitable for the models.  

The Fake News dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/techykajal/fakereal-news).
